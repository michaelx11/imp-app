Hi all, we are in need of additional people.
<% unless @no_meal_dates.empty? %>

There are no meals currently scheduled for the following dates:
    <% @no_meal_dates.each do |date| %>   
    <%= date.strftime('%A') %> <%= date.to_s %>
    <% end %>
<% end %>
<% unless @unshopped_meal_events.empty? %>

There are no shopping runs currently scheduled for meals on the following dates:
    <% @unshopped_meal_events.each do |meal_event| %>
    <%= Meal.find_by_id(meal_event.meal_id).name %> on <%= date.strftime('%A') %> <%= meal_event.date %>
    <% end %>
<% end %>
